## What is CORNTENNA?

CORNTENNA is a handheld network reconnaissance tool designed to map the digital neighborhood around you.

Plug it in.

Connect to a network.

Watch the devices reveal themselves.

Routers.
Phones.
Printers.
Smart TVs.
Mystery boxes with suspiciously open ports.

Every device leaves a trail.

CORNTENNA follows it.

## Philosophy

Networks are ecosystems.

Every device broadcasts a story.

Most people never notice.

CORNTENNA exists for the people who do.

Not because we want to break things.

Because we want to understand them.

---

## Legal

Only scan networks you own or have permission to analyze.

Don't be the reason your ISP sends weird emails.
